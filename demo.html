				<h1>Critical Log – Website Development - Report</h1>
				<p>The aspect of the site that I anticipated would create the most problems regarding interoperability and discrepancies between versions was the canvas and other elements that made up the poster design page. This page required a significant amount of Javascript implementation to function as intended and used some elements that are non-standardised. </p>
				<p>For example, the colour input element functioned as intended on Chrome and Firefox with a menu pop-up that allowed for intuitive colour picking. For Internet Explorer however, this feature was not fully implemented, so instead of a fleshed-out colour wheel, the user could only type in a hexadecimal value that would correspond to the colour. This presented a problem that turned out to be unsolvable without the use of something called a polyfill. I debated attempting to implement something like this but decided against for two reasons. One, it seemed to me to fall outside the parameters of the task, which were that only HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript were used. Some polyfills can be implemented solely using Javascript but others require other types of mark-up to implement and this fell outside the scope of the assignment. Two, the colour picker actually still functions in Internet Explorer, only the interface is much less intuitive. I elected on balance to invest more time in developing other areas of the site and accept that this one feature would have slight differences across browsers.</p>
				<p>The W3C validation process highlighted several aspects of the code that needed addressing. Every image required an alt tag containing text that would be displayed if the image failed to load. This is important to give some information to the user about what the image is supposed to show in the event they can’t see themselves. </p>
				<p>It also highlighted problems with the HTML mark-up regarding the iframe element and the embedding of YouTube videos. Some superfluous code is added when retrieving the embed information from the video. Other aspects are better implemented in a separate CSS file rather than in-line, for example removing the default border around the video.</p>
				<p>Developing to make the website compatible for mobile and other size screen turned out to be a challenge. I found the three column structure to be invaluable and used it twice for the website. As well as a simple and pleasing layout on a computer screen, it was fairly simple to use media queries in the CSS to switch to two columns and then one as the screen shrank, making it a very versatile layout and great for mobile and tablets as well. Images conformed easily to this layout but YouTube videos again presented a problem. While the width would adjust according to the column width, the height would remain fixed and the dimensions of the video would change with the screen size. The solution I arrived at was to abandon the continuous scaling of the video and simply have three discrete sizes that the videos would snap to depending on the screen size.</p>
				<p>For a small number of elements in the site I used box-sizing: border-box which changes the way sizing works so that padding, etc. are included in the total size rather than adding to it. I found this to be a better and more intuitive way to size elements than the default and in hindsight I would’ve implemented the CSS for the whole site like this if I’d been familiar with it from the beginning. As it was, I decided it would be laborious to implement this back throughout the original code and would have limited benefits beyond consistency.</p>
				<p>Overall the website is fairly traditional in it’s design, having no features in the way of parallax scrolling or similar effects. This was a conscious design choice reflecting my opinion that websites that implement features like these sacrifice usability and user experience for aesthetics and innovation. For me it was more important to design a site that was simple and easy to navigate and understand, but wasn’t tired or bland. To this end, simple but elegant animations, as well as a simple colour palette were important. The black and white theme fits with the band aesthetic as well.</p>
				<p>Overall I would say that while the Javascript proved a challenging task to grapple with, I found the CSS to be harder to make work the way I wanted. It is difficult to say to what extent this was due to my inexperience or anything else, however I found it tedious that to implement something often required a new line for every browser or specification. Overall I found it to be a difficult and tedious tool to work with. Some of the similarities of Javascipt with other programming languages may have improved my understanding of it and therefore my opinion of it in comparison to CSS.</p>
